This is the software Rod Read used to control his Daisy Kite turbine on 13/12/2018
The flying rigid rotor kite trubine output over 1kW so this is NO TOY and not for the faint of heart.
Wear a helmet and other protective gear. Stand far clear and not directly downwind or anywhere lashback will be a concern.
You can see just how insane this is here https://youtu.be/UpIECYxP4xc
