This is the software Rod Read used to control his Daisy Kite turbine on 13/12/2018
The flying rigid rotor kite trubine output over 1kW so this is NO TOY and not for the faint of heart.
Wear a helmet and other protective gear. Stand far clear and not directly downwind or anywhere lashback will be a concern.

You can see just how insane this is here https://youtu.be/UpIECYxP4xc

I was too lazy to reinstate a previous push button for manual overdrive to take twists out... doh
I also aught to go back to having a manual current control for careful slowing down...

As you can see my code is about as far from optimal as a noob like me can mangle


Thanks
